# Multiple Window 3D Scene

This project creates a 3D scene where objects are synchronized across multiple browser windows using `localStorage`.

## Instructions

1.  **Start the Server**:
    Running `npx.cmd serve .` in this directory is required.

2.  **Open in Browser**:
    Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) depending on port.

3.  **Use Multiple Windows**:
    Open the same URL in a second/third window.
    Drag the windows around to see the cubes move relative to each other.

4.  **Troubleshooting**:
    If the cubes don't appear or sync:
    - Ensure you allowing popups/local storage.
    - Refresh the page.
    - Check browser console for errors.
